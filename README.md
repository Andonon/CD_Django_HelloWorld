Coding Dojo Django "Hello World" assignment. 

Hello World
Make a hello world app.

By now you know that 'hello world' is shorthand for the most basic version of a thing we can possibly make. You'll need to do the following:

Set up a new project: You might have to review. Start from the beginning if you don't remember. Your project should be called HelloWorld.

Start a new app: Don't skip creating an apps folder or making __init__.py.

Modify settings.py: Refer back to the Getting Started tab if needed.

Create templates: Refer back to the URLs URLs and Views tab if needed. Don't forget to make an /appname directory in your templates directory.

Render the template: when a user visits your root route.

Ninja: print "hello world" in the console when the root route is visited.
